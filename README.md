I love designing, creating, and my goal is to build applications that contribute to a smoother and more streamlined experience for users. Being able to be in the healthcare industry has not only grown my understanding for empathy and improving lives, but itâ€™s also provided me with the problem solving skills and major attention to detail needed to be a developer.<p>

Before learning to code, I already had a big project in mind. I am actively building SurgAssist, a platform that aims to simplify the tasks of all those present in the operating room, supporting allied health professionals in enhancing the fluidity and efficiency of surgeries, ultimately ensuring patients experience a seamless and secure journey.<p>
When Iâ€™m not obsessively learning and in front of my computer, you can probably find me either somewhere exploring with my chocolate Labrador, eating sushi, in the kitchen experimenting with new recipes, reading a thriller novel, or planning my next hike.
Get in touch and let's build something together!
